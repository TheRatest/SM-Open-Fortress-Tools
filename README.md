# Open-Fortress-Tools
Basic gamedata, plugin, and include file for extra SourceMod features for Open Fortress.

Install SourceMod as normal from the SourceMod.net [website](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php), and then install this plugin and its gamedata over top of it.

As of revision 19 (0.19.0), it is required to use STOCK SourceMod extensions and binaries, instead of the previously manually compiled OF binaries. You now ONLY need the plugin, gamedata, and includes, if you want to shim in TF2 natives modified to work with Open Fortress.
